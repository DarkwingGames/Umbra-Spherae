You only need to do this once

1. Install this: https://git-lfs.github.com/

2. Open the Git Shell (I have a shortcut in the desktop for it, if not try to install it from the github site or something)

3. type "cd Umbra-Spherae" without the "

4. type "git lfs track "*.bmp""

5. type "git add .gitattributes"

Done, now you can upload big bmp files, do it normally in Github.
In the first time it will take a long time to upload things as all the bmps will be tagged.
I'll try to check later if we can only refer the map folder (when the new large map is fully functional).
