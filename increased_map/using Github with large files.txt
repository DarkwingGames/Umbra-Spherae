You only need to do this once

1. make sure the file over 100 Mb is not placed in the Github directory yet

2. Install this: https://git-lfs.github.com/

3. Open the Git Shell (I have a shortcut in the desktop for it, if not try to install it from the github site or something)

4. type "cd Umbra-Spherae\increased_map" without the "

5. type "git lfs track "*.bmp""

6. place the big file in the increased_map folder

Done, now you can upload big bmp files, do it normally in Github.
