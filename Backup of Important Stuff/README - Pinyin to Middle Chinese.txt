To change from Pinyin to Middle Chinese

1) Go to the localisation folder
2) Rename the files "0_US_provinces_rmiddle_chinese.csv" and "0_US_china_rmiddle_chinese.csv"
to "0_US_provinces_middle_chinese.csv" and "0_US_china_middle_chinese.csv"

If you want to go back to pinyin give them the original name ("0_US_provinces_rmiddle_chinese.csv" and "0_US_china_rmiddle_chinese.csv"),
so that the files in pinyin are loaded first in the alphabetical order.
